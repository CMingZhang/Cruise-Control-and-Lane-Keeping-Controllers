# Cruise-Control-and-Lane-Keeping-Controllers
Developed is a vehicle dynamics model that encompasses both the latitudinal and longitudinal aspects of motion. Built on top is a Cruise Control and Lane Keeping System using PID controllers.
This was a collaborative effort of mine and Ms. Anqi Zheng (anqizhen@usc.edu) for our directed research under the tutelage of Professor Dr. Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh (http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jdeshmuk/) at the University of Southern California.
